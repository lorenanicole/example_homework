# Demo Github Classroom Assignment

This is a demo Github Classroom assignment! In this demo assignment you will:

- Learn how to work with GitHub Classroom
- Modify the `hello_world.py` by sharing a fun fact about yourself, or whatever! Really, it can be whatever you like. When you enter the fun fact put it on the line after Lorena's fun fact!
- Submit the assignment

## To start

- Clone the repository down
- Open the `hello_world.py` file and add a new `print`ed `str` to include a fun fact about you or something entirely random. Place that on the line after Lorena's fun fact! 
- Review the GitHub Action, does the test pass?
- Checkin the work into GitHub Classroom by:
    - Stage the work `git add hello_world.py`
    - Commit with a meaningful commit message e.g. `git commit -m "Modified hello world to include name"` 
    - Push the work `git push origin main`
- Confirm the work has been submitted in GitHub Classrom
